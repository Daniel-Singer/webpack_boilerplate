# A super simple webpack boilerplate

### Getting started

Pull or fetch the code and then run following command:

```javascript
npm install 
```

This is going to install all the needed packages.

After that, open your console and run

```javascript
npm run dev
```

This is going to start the webpack dev server and opens a new browser window.



The boilerplate is set up to support Sass and Scss.
